# Pym.js

Using iframes in a responsive page can be frustrating. It&rsquo;s easy enough to make an iframe&rsquo;s width span 100% of its container, but sizing its height is tricky &mdash; especially if the content of the iframe changes height depending on page width (for example, because of text wrapping or media queries) or events within the iframe.

<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nprapps/pym.js/master/src/pym.js">Pym.js</a> embeds and resizes an iframe responsively (width and height) within its parent container. It also bypasses the usual cross-domain issues.

Use case: The NPR Visuals team uses Pym.js to embed small custom bits of code (charts, maps, etc.) inside our CMS without CSS or JavaScript conflicts. [See an example of this in action.](http://www.npr.org/2014/03/25/293870089/maze-of-college-costs-and-aid-programs-trap-some-families)
